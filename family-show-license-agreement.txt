Limitations on License

(a)
This license is not assignable or transferable by operation of law or otherwise, except upon the express written consent of the
parties, but no assignment shall relieve the parties of their respective obligations as to performances rendered, acts done and
obligations incurred prior to the effective date of the assignment.
(b)
This license is limited to LICENSEE and to the premises where each Family Show is presented, and does not authorize any
performances other than those given at the premises as part of licensed Family Shows presented by or under the auspices of
LICENSEE.

(c)
This license does not authorize the broadcasting, telecasting or transmission by wire, Internet, webcasting or on-line service,
or otherwise of renditions of musical compositions in the ASCAP repertory to persons outside of the premises where each Family
Show shall be presented.
(d)
This license is limited to non-dramatic performances, and does not authorize any dramatic performances, or any performance

dramatic performance shall mean a performance of a musical composition in which there is a definite plot depicted by action and
where the performance of the musical composition is woven into and carries forward the plot and its accompanying action, including,
but not limited to, any “dramatico-musical work, in whole or in part, or the performance of any composition from any “dramaticomusical work” in a manner that recreates the performance of such composition with substantially such distinctive scenery or costume
as was used in the presentation of such “dramatico-musical work” (whether or not such “dramatico-musical work” was presented on
the stage or in motion picture form). The use of dialogue to establish a theme or the use of any non-dramatic device merely to
introduce a performance of a composition shall not be deemed to make such performance dramatic. The term “dramatico-musical
work” includes, but is not limited to, an opera, operetta, musical comedy, play with music, revue, ballet or like production.

This license does not authorize the performance of any special orchestral arrangements or transcriptions of any musical
composition in the ASCAP repertory, unless such arrangements or transcriptions have been copyrighted by members of ASCAP or
foreign societies that have granted ASCAP the right to license such performances. ASCAP reserves the right at any time to restrict the
first American performance of any composition in its repertory, if so directed by the member(s) in interest.
(f)
ASCAP reserves the right at any time to withdraw from its repertory and from operation of this license, any musical work as
to which any suit has been brought or threatened on a claim that such composition infringes a composition not contained in ASCAP’s
repertory, or on a claim that ASCAP does not have the right to license the performing rights in such composition, provided, however,
that ASCAP shall provide LICENSEE with written notice prior to excepting any particular composition from the license grant
pursuant to this Section.
(g)
This license does not authorize any performance by means of a coin-operated phonorecord player (jukebox) for which a
license is otherwise available from the Jukebox License Office.

This license shall not extend to any performance presented or promoted by LICENSEE at any premises that occurred prior to
the effective date of this license.
