contrary between LICENSEE and the other party.

license by giving LICENSEE thirty days notice to cure such breach or default, and in the event that such breach or
default has not been cured within said thirty days, this license shall terminate on the expiration of such thirty-day

Right To Verify Reports

(a)
Upon thirty days written notice to LICENSEE, ASCAP shall have the right, by its duly authorized
representatives, at any time during customary business hours, to examine the books and records of account and
program information of LICENSEE only to such extent as may be necessary to verify any and all reports rendered
and accountings made by LICENSEE to ASCAP. ASCAP shall consider all data and information coming to its
attention as the result of any such examination as completely and entirely confidential.
(b)
The period for which ASCAP may audit pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited to three calendar years
preceding the year in which the audit is made; provided, however, that if an audit is postponed at LICENSEE’s
request, ASCAP shall have the right to audit for the period commencing with the third calendar year preceding the
year in which notification of intention to audit was first given by ASCAP to LICENSEE. This three-year limitation
shall not apply if LICENSEE fails or refuses after written notice from ASCAP to produce the books and records
necessary to verify any report or statement of accounting required pursuant to this Agreement. Should the threeyear audit period extend into a previous license agreement, nothing herein shall restrict ASCAP’s right to audit for
the full three calendar years preceding the year in which notification was given.
(c)
If any such examination shows LICENSEE to have underpaid the license fees due ASCAP by 5% or more,
LICENSEE shall pay a finance charge on the license fees shown due of 1.5% per month from the date(s) the license
fees should have been paid pursuant to this Agreement.

demands payment of such amount.

presents concerts which is applicable to the licensing of performing rights. In the event of such termination, ASCAP
shall refund to LICENSEE any unearned license fees paid in advance.
