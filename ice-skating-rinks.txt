Using the grid above, find your Highest Admission Price, then determine
which square footage column your skating rink would fall under. This will
determine your ASCAP Annual License Fees.

Fees should be calculated and paid separately for each rink at the premises for which a separate admission is charged. If a single
admission is charged for entry to multiple rinks at the same premises, aggregate the square footage of all included rinks for which such
admission charge applies.
A. HIGHEST ADMISSION PRICE
The highest normal price of admission to the ice skating rink. This does not refer to the price of admission to extraordinary events at the
ice skating rink, which are not regularly scheduled. Highest Admission Price includes all fees included in such price, such as skate rental
fees, if such built-in fees are not separately made available.
B. SEASONAL RATES
If the Premise is only open seasonally, the fees due for periods up to four (4) months of operation are one-half (1/2) of the annual
license fee. For each additional month or partial month the fee is increased by one-twelfth (1/12) the annual license fee. In no event shall
the fees for seasonal performances be more than the annual license fee.
C. DISCOUNTS.
(1) A five percent (5%) discount will be applied to all above rates when the entire annual payment is made in advance on or before
January 15th. (2) Starting in 2017, a separate five percent (5%) discount will be applied to all annual payments made in advance on or
before January 15th through the secured ASCAP website.

FEE FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2017 AND BEYOND
The license fee for calendar year 2017 and each subsequent year shall be the license fee for the preceding year adjusted in accordance
with the increase in the Consumer Price Index -- All Urban Consumers -- (CPI-U) between the preceding October and the next preceding
October, rounded to the nearest dollar.
