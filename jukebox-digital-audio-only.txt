accordance with the following provisions of this Article 4 and Article 5, Licensee agrees to pay
ASCAP, for each calendar quarter during the Term, a Quarterly License Fee (as hereinafter defined)
calculated pursuant to Section 4.2.

Calculate the “Monthly License Rate” per Digital Jukebox by dividing the “Annual License Rate” for
such year, as set forth in Section 4.3, by 12. Step 2. Calculate the “Monthly License Fee” per Digital
Jukebox for each month during a given calendar quarter by multiplying the Monthly License Rate per
Digital Jukebox for each month during the quarter by the total number of Digital Jukeboxes that are
in operation for any period of time during the preceding month. Step 3. Add the Monthly License
Fees for all months in such calendar quarter to determine the Quarterly License Fee for such quarter.
For purposes of this Agreement, a Digital Jukebox “in operation” is a Digital Jukebox that has
generated revenue during the applicable period.
4.3. Annual Rates. The Annual License Rates for each Digital Jukebox actually in operation
during the applicable calendar year shall be as follows: (i) for calendar years through December 31,
2014, an Annual License Rate of $55.00; and (ii), for calendar years 2015 and thereafter, an Annual
License Fee equal to the Annual License Rate for the preceding calendar year, adjusted in accordance

any required payment that is not made within 30 days of its due date.
5.

Jukebox licensed hereunder; (b) the name and location of the Premises where each Digital Jukeboxes

for such report.

Right of Verification

6.1
Right to Examination. Upon 45 days’ written notice, ASCAP shall have the right by its

and records of account to such extent as may be necessary solely to verify the reports or other information
and payments based thereon that are required by this Agreement. All data and information derived from
ASCAP’s examination shall be treated as completely confidential pursuant to Paragraph 10. The period
for which ASCAP may examine Licensee’s books and records of account pursuant to this Agreement
shall be limited to three calendar years preceding the year in which the examination is made; provided,
however, that, if an audit is postponed at Licensee’s request, then ASCAP shall have the right to examine

3

books and records for the period commencing with the third calendar year preceding the year in which
notification of intention to examine was first given by ASCAP. This three-year limitation shall not apply
if Licensee fails or refuses after written notice from ASCAP to produce the books and records necessary
to verify any report or statement of accounting required pursuant to this Agreement.
6.2
Results of Examination. If any examination under Paragraph 6.1 shows that the license fees due
ASCAP from Licensee have been underpaid by 10% or more, then Licensee shall pay a late payment fee
on the balance shown due of 1% per month from the date(s) the license fees should have been paid
pursuant to this Agreement. If any such examination shows that the license fees due ASCAP from
Licensee have been underpaid by less than 10%, then Licensee shall pay a late payment fee on the
balance shown due of 1% per month from the date ASCAP demands payment of such amount. However,
no such late payment charge shall be assessed if payment of the license fee balance shown due is made
within 45 days of receipt of written notification from ASCAP of underpayment. If such examination
shows an overpayment of license fees, then ASCAP shall credit or refund the amount of such
overpayment, at Licensee’s election, within 30 days. Late payment fees payable under this Paragraph 6.2
shall only be for a maximum period that is coterminous with the period for which additional license fees
are owed pursuant to ASCAP’s audit examination.
